## Inspiration
As we looked through the sustainability goals, we felt passionate towards a few of the goals and felt compelled to create an app that can potentially help to eleviate the situation by giving a proper solution. 

After deciding on the sustainability goal we want to pursue and achieve, one of our members brought up a video of how a car was upcycled and still used as if it was brand new. This gave us the inspiration on the direction we want to move towards for our app and thus, as we were deciding on the features, we thought of how best to encourage people to upcycle and also provide them with the knowledge on how to do so.

## What it does

## How we built it
We made use of flutter and dart as our main languages and we used android studio as our platform. 

We made a UI prototype of how the app should look like through Figma and did numerous editing and changes to make the overall UI suitable and appealing for users to download and use.

We proceeded to code out our app according to what we have designed in our UI and explored different ways that we can make our features stand out more. Eventually, we felt that the design can be further improved to make it more appealing and thus, we made changes to our figma designs again.

As time was tight after a further improvement of design, our codes did not have the current UI implementation but still functions as it should.

## Challenges we ran into
####It was challenging to decide on what we want in our application to properly aid in sustainability.
<br>
####As our group was relatively new to flutter and did not have experience using Android Studio, it took a longer time to get started on the coding of the application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to learn new languages - flutter and dart and even a new programming platform - android studio. 

Additionally, we felt that we came up with an idea which is refreshing and something new.
## What we learned
We learned about the new languages and platforms as mentioned above and the sustainability goals that we shld take note of more. 

We became more open-minded on what an application can the kind of features that will help bring out the purpose of our application more.

It gave us a clearer understanding on the importance of a target audience and how to encourage people to be more aware of sustainability goals by allowing this app to create a community.

## What's next for R3Make
We envision that in the future, R3Make will be able to host online and physicals gatherings for people that have a passion for upcycling and repairing old goods.
